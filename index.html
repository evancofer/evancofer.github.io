<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>My name is Evan Cofer and this is my personal website.</p>
<p>This site is currently under construction, as you can probably tell.</p>
<p>My goal is for this page to (eventually) serve as an electronic resume,a blog,</p>
<p>and also as a place for me to experiment with web development.</p>
<p>Hosting is provided by GitHub Pages.</p>
