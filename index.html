		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://www.deboramarkslab.com/">Marks Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School, where I work on modeling genetic variation in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome.
		In 2023 I received my PhD in Quantitative and Computational Biology from Princeton University, where I was advised by <a href="https://function.princeton.edu/">Olga Troyanskaya</a>.
		I received my BS in Computer Science from Trinity University in 2017.</p>

		<p>I work on computational techniques for analyzing large-scale sets of genomic variation.
		In general, I am interested in how we can develop and use machine learning models to better understand, predict, and design regulatory mechanisms.
		</p>

		<p>In my free time, I like to rock climb and play tabletop RPGs.</p>
